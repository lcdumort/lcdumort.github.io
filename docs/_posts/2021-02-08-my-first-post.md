Hi and welcome to my personal website! The idea of starting a blog has been on 
my mind for quite some time now. A lonely friday-evening during the 
Corona-crisis.

The content will be technology-based with a focus on my research topics and 
hobbies. You can thus expect machine learning based posts as well as 
cryptocurrency discussions. Posts will often, if not always, include code.

Once I finish researching or developing a project, expect a tutorial to follow
such that everyone can understand my train of thoughts!

Stay tuned and feel free to reach out!
