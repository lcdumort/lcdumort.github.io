Welcome to my personal website! I am a 1st year PhD student at the Center for Molecular Modeling, Faculty of Sciences, Ghent University. My research concentration is developing machine learning based optimization techniques for reactive molecular dynamics. I am interested in learning more about state-of-the-art learning methods, and applying them to solve classical scientific problems.

When not working on my PhD, I have multiple hobbies. For starters, my passion for coding doesn't end at working hours. I like to develop projects related to real-world problems or writing some handy scripts. I also combine coding with another passion, cryptocurrencies. 

When I'm not behind a computer screen, I like to be creative with my ukulele or guitar and jam around while running and gym keep my body fit. Finally, I really like travelling and seeing the world especially by motorcycle.
