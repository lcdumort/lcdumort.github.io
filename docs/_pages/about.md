I am a 1st year PhD student at the Center for Molecular Modeling, Faculty of Sciences, Ghent University. My research concentration is developing machine learning based optimization techniques for reactive molecular dynamics. I am interested in learning more about state-of-the-art learning methods, and applying them to solve classical scientific problems.
