I am a 2nd year PhD student at the Center for Molecular Modeling, Faculty of Sciences, Ghent University. My research concentrates on developing machine learning based optimization techniques for reactive molecular dynamics. I am interested in learning more about state-of-the-art learning methods, and applying them to solve classical scientific problems.

When not working on my PhD, I have multiple hobbies. My passion for coding does not end at working hours. I like to develop projects related to real-world problems or writing some handy scripts. I also combine coding with another passion, cryptocurrencies. 

When I'm not behind a computer screen, I like to be creative with my ukulele or guitar and jam around. Photography is a real art for me, that I try to do as well when the opportunity arises. You can find some examples in my Gallery. I go running and go to the gym. Finally, I am passionate about seeing the world and meeting other people especially by motorcycle.
