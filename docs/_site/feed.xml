The idea of starting a blog has been on 
my mind for quite some time now. A lonely friday-evening during the 
Corona-crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content will be technology-based with a focus on my research topics and 
hobbies. You can thus expect machine learning based posts as well as 
cryptocurrency discussions. Posts will often, if not always, include code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I finish researching or developing a project, expect a tutorial to follow
such that everyone can understand my train of thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned and feel free to reach out!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lo誰c Dumortier</name></author><category term="Blog" /><summary type="html">Hi and welcome to my personal website!
